# CatPhotoApp
This project talks about building a simple Photo based application for Cats in HTML. It gives brief idea about basic HTML tags. 
The idea for this project is taken from freecodecamp website (which I am currently using to refreh my computer skils), kudos to them. 
I am capturing my learning with this git repository so that I can re-learn it whenever required.
